                            As the autumn auction season approaches experts indicate that collecting lots has become much harder than previous years – the auction industry is being flooded by counterfeits.

                            The autumn auction season approaches. Each auction house’s collection work is also coming to an end. Nevertheless, industry professionals are finding it hard to collect auction lots in a depressed art market being flooded by counterfeits. At the same time, this year’s spring auction where the starting price of heavy weight lots was set too high seems to have given the market the following signal: identifying fakes is difficult, counterfeits have damaged buyers’ confidence and the ongoing development of the art market.  Guangzhou Daily has interviewed industry experts to give collectors valuable market information prior to the autumn auction.

                                What can China, in the early stage of development of its art market, learn from the advanced Western auction markets? Guangzhou Daily put this question to Sotheby’s Institute visiting lecturer, Art Asia CEO Yuanyuan Tan. The Art Asia legal group led by Yuanyuan Tan was commissioned by the China Association of Auctioneers, and has been researching the laws and regulations of major Western countries as well as the question of liability for defects in auction lots for over two years. The cases Ms Tan mentioned provide food for thought for art professionals in China.

                                Guangzhou Daily:  What are the main means by which Western auction houses collect auction lots? Do they come across counterfeits?

                                Ms Tan: The main Western auction houses such as Sotheby’s and Christies have over 200 years of experience, and have amassed large client networks and information resources, the main way in which they collect is to directly ask their clients, and they are also willing to receive emails from the public asking the estimated price and making bidding requests.

                        <p>
                            <div class="news_p">
                                In the past, this method by which large Western auction houses collected through their old clients was reliable, and counterfeits rarely appeared. However, if there was excessive demand for a certain type or certain artist’s work in the market, with demand exceeding supply, at this point the auction house had no option but to apply pressure to the various channels of collection, and they easily came across counterfeits that appeared to make the numbers.

                                Guangzhou Daily: Once the auction lot has been successfully sold, if the buyer can prove that it is a counterfeit, will a legal dispute arise with the auction house?

                                Ms Tan: Normally the buyer will use an expert evaluation in order to determine whether the auction lot is a fake or not, and will use legal means to uphold their rights. For example in 1994 a Canadian millionaire successfully bid for two “18th century” Georgian wooden chairs from the UK’s Sotheby’s auction house for £463,500,000.  The information provided by Sotheby’s at the auction stated that these two chairs had been acquired from the fourth Earl of Bern in 1759. However, in 1999 it was discovered through expert evaluation that these two chairs were counterfeits and had been manufactured in 1990. After the event Sotheby’s took on the responsibility for guaranteeing the authenticity of the auction lot and instructed the relevant insurance company to fully reimburse the buyer, and at the same time tried to freeze the assets of the seller who they sued for damages.

                                Guangzhou Daily: Chinese experts state that the principle in China’s Auction Law which does not require the seller to guarantee the authenticity of the good they are selling is based on international examples, is this true?

                                Ms Tan: The legal systems of Western countries are not identical, and the principles and methods by way each system deals with the question of liability and disclaimers for defects in auction lots are all different. Let’s take for example an auction that took place in Germany: in 2013 the German Federal Court heard an auction case where the counterfeit at hand was a Buddha from the Sui Dynasty. The description of the Buddha in the auction catalogue stated “Seated Buddha, Sui Dynasty, 581-681 AD, starting price 3,800 Euros.” After having bought the Buddha for the price of 20,2950 Euros the claimant asked an expert to evaluate it and discovered that it was a counterfeit. After the buyer’s requests to dissolve the contract and to be reimbursed were refused by the auction house, they filed a claim with the state level court.  The said auction house had the following stipulations in its auction terms and conditions: the buyer does not have the right to make any claim for damages against the auction house regarding any defects in an auction lot, and the auction house is not liable for any physical loss other than in cases of intentional or gross negligence. In the appeal the German Federal Court ruled that when an auction house has given a specific date to an auction lot in its description in its catalogue and expert evaluation of the object shows that it does not date from such period, and is instead a modern counterfeit, the auction house is not allowed to rely on disclaimers held within its terms and conditions. As the object was found to be counterfeit, the buyer was granted the right to dissolve the contract and was not subject to the auction’s house disclaimer of liability clauses.

                        <p>
                            <div class="news_p">
                                Following the taking of effect of the “Standard Terms Act” in Germany, the “Sui Dynasty Buddha” case passed by the German Federal Court in 2013 has had a corrective and restrictive effect on auction cases. According to the latest ruling of the Federal Court, in principle auction houses can use standard terms to avoid liability for defects in lots. However when the auction houses have made an error, or have not fulfilled their due diligence obligations of investigation and inspection, they cannot use disclaimers to avoid their liability towards the buyer. Auction houses cannot categorically put all the liability onto their agent in such situations. This new ruling is concerned with the fact that the auction house had clearly ascribed a certain date to the lot, and had not in fact fulfilled its due diligence obligation to determine whether the lot was a fake or not.
